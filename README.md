Day 05: Password Generator

Welcome to **Day 05** of my **100 Days of Python Challenge**! 🚀  
This repository contains a **Password Generator** project, designed to create strong, customizable passwords.

📝 Project Description

The **Password Generator** allows users to:
1. Input the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers in their password.
2. Generate a randomized password that meets the specified criteria.
3. Ensure the password is strong and unpredictable by shuffling the components.

🛠️ Key Features:
- Uses Python's 'random' library to generate secure passwords.
- Allows flexibility in password composition.
- Outputs a randomized password each time.


🎯 Purpose

This project is designed to:
Strengthen understanding of lists, loops, and randomization in Python.
Highlight the importance of strong passwords for security.
Create a fun and interactive coding experience.

🌟 Acknowledgments
Inspired by the 100 Days of Python Challenge, this project demonstrates how programming can contribute to cybersecurity and personal security.
